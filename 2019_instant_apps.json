Not just worthwhile, but value so compelling that it demands prioritizing instant apps over all the other things a company's engineers could be doing with their time.\n\nIt's a neat idea and a cool piece of technology, but that's kind of a hard sell when they already need to divide their efforts between a mobile site, desktop site, and two (Android and iOS) native apps.\n\nAnother issue is that you have to be able to separate out your app into pieces so that parts of them can be loaded without bringing in the other parts. If your app predates instant apps or just wasn't designed with that in mind, its design may not make that easy. So in some cases people need to do a rewrite or refactor of their code to even make it possible, which is possible, but it adds one more obstacle.", "An Instant App is a native app with limited permissions. I deal with React and Angular based apps constantly, and they are offensively bad. As an example of how much worse their UX is, they still don't use Android's networking APIs (because the underlying framework doesn't support it). [Here's the only reference to ConnectivityManager in the whole react-native repository](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/794d2264f93b6eaeab4eb53c7d2eaf7880b89649/ReactAndroid/src/main/java/com/facebook/react/modules/netinfo/NetInfoModule.java). This means that every time your phone switches networks, they stick on the old network (even if it's a cell network and charging you money) until the OS kills their sockets. Then they tell the user that connectivity sucks and start reloading everything. If they are this bad on connection management, it stands to reason that the rest is just as horrid, and it is.

You just dont see it in higher level languages.\n\nBut the other reply hits the nail on the head. The app needs to switch between let's say mobile and and wifi.
