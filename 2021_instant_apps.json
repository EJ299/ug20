They are primarily available on [felvin.com](https://felvin.com) (which is another search engine) e.g. [https://felvin.com/search?q=flappy%20bird](https://felvin.com/search?q=flappy%20bird) \n\nBut we're working to distributing these apps on [Google.com](https://Google.com) and other search engines (e.g. duckduckgo) through browser extension.", "The web search results are coming from Google API. We have other plugins like search directly from the GitHub API and search on Google Drive or Notion. Though these are on the older website and we haven't moved it to the new website yet, checkout: [https://neera.ai/](https://neera.ai/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe plan to allow people to integrate their own plugins soon, stay tuned :)", "Are the app\u2019s proprietary for felvin.com?

Because the engine will come with the os and flutter apps are first class citizens. \nOn iOS  and windows it's not possible as they'll never agree to it. \n\nMay be it can be done in Android but it'll not work on previous versions of Android and it's totally upto the Android team. \n\nLinux is leaning more towards flutter so there might be a possibility \ud83e\udd1e.\n\nFor web Google tried shipping dart SDK but js devs backlashed, the won't welcome the new kid on their turf. So shipping flutter engine would be out of the question.\n\nAlso is there any possibility of downloading the engine seperately from the app once installed so all flutter apps can use this. The engine app must be automatically updated to the required versions requested from the apps. If it's possible we can reduce a the size.. just being optimistic I know it's not possible.. but java apps do it, the majority of the os ship jvm with it or you install seperately to support it.", "I might be going off the beaten path here, but to me it seems like getting Dart to bootstrap itself would go a long way in improving the speed.  I think of languages like Red/Rebol, Nim, and I think Zig.", "Yea, we do need instant app support. For that I believe the .so files size has to be reduced.

Granted. But there\u2019s and equal or greater amount of businesses that just want some sort of interface on a client\u2018s device. Think takeaway food. Where I live most local shops let you order food directly from their website or through some sort of proxy. I don\u2019t spend a lot of time on these sites/in these apps. They are really only a means to an end. Any sensible business decision would conclude in just shipping the mobile site. Yeah, UX is horrible. Will that stop me from ordering food from them though?

From what I recall the size needs to be pretty small which is usually extremely difficult for a multi platform framework such as flutter.\n\nLast I checked a \u201chello world\u201d flutter app was around 5mb. So it will work assuming you can then keep the rest of your app within the limitations for instant and clips.\n\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but I think it was 10mb so if your app really simply needs 1 screen and your assets are small or not shipped with it you should be fine. 5mb is still a lot of room to play with really.", "yes, it is possible. My recommendation, tho, is to keep 2 separate projects, one for the pull app and one for the app clip.", "Is there any guide on packaging the native instant app project with the flutter project?", "This is what I did for my project and it\u2019s worked out really well!", "Yes, just google it :)", "I have googled, I can't find anything that even indicates it's possible. If you don't mind helping me I will send you $5 USD of crypto on Coinbase. Ill be specific, the project needs to be multi module, mostly written in flutter (several screens), but 1 screen (module) will be an android instant app / iOS appclip. That screen can be isolated from the main app but it all has to be one package.", "if you type \"flutter app clip\" in G, you'll see the official guide and one github issue.", "Android instant apps is what I'm more interested in, and that example has a disclaimer that says it won't even work for production (app size >10mb).\n\nI know it's possible to deploy a flutter app as an instant app, but I need to know how to package it in such a way that the instant app is a seperate native module that will be very small (1 screen).
