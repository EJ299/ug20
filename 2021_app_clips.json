You can avoid the hold by going in store and paying with your debit card by pin since you are stating exactly how much gas you are paying for as the pumps are able to prevent you from pumping any more than that.  I can usually use my card just fine even with a hold as long as I was charged for the actual transaction on my bank account.

Eventually, I finished in April 2020 and launched it. \n\nAfter that I started working on open-source and other small projects. Find remained in a very beta-looking state until December 2020, when I got interested in it again. I released a complete redesign, v1.2, this February.
