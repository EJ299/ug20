Sure, you can pay with Apple Pay on website too but AppClips are not much bigger in size compared to modern website and end user should feel more secure (it is an app on AppStore, not random website he visits to pay for something). Additionally compared to simple website an app like that can give additional functionality. For example let\u2019s say you could pay for parking like that. Notification when your time is about to expire would be supper easy to implement. \n\nTL;DR\nAppClips are not full apps and are much smaller but can add additional functionality compared to standard websites.

In fact all tap transactions, whether it be Google Pay Apple Pay or your physical card actually cost less than swiping a card. The fees that Apple takes (varies by country) come from the Bank, since:\na) There\u2019s less chance of card fraud. You have to authenticate your iPhone with Touch ID, Face ID or Passcode, prior to payment, compared to tapping your card and simply paying.\nb) The banks hope to capture the small purchases using your cards now. Since you already have your phone in hand, why not tap your phone for that coffee or sandwich, instead of finding cash.", "This is super interesting to me!

Instead of using something universal like QR codes or NFC, Apple created this and locks it just to iOS users which limits it's usefulness.", "Well I have to disagree with you about the fee.  Apple Pay charges most merchants around 2 to 3% processing fee, while for large merchants they can often get their processing fees to under 1% through their acquirer for their Visa/MasterCard/Discover transactions. That is why major retailers like Walmart and cvs initially resisted Apple Pay.

We also don\u2019t use Chip and pin for our credit cards as chip and signature is the standard.  That is part of the reason card fraud is higher in the US.

These app clips would be perfect for that.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if they get used heavily in physical stores to give more information about products or offer some sort of alternative way to purchase things. In the demo they were showing electric scooters, which seems like a perfect use case to me. Another might be public transport. These guys don't care whether you have an account or not. They would prefer it, but their main preference is that you actually use their service and pay them.\n\nI could also imagine it being used in restaurants to make take away orders. Think how in Mcdonalds you have those big touchscreen ordering machines. McDonalds also has an app that can do the same, but who wants to have the McDonalds app on their phone? I am sure various food delivery/takeaway apps will integrate app clips.\n\nBut like you say, I can imagine this is totally uninteresting for apps that offer free services in return for your data.", "Beneficial to developers? What planet are you living on? Developers design for the end users...", "No worries at all! \n\nProbably very true, it will change the game. Is that a good thing? Well that depends on how you approach it. Also means that you might acquire new users from App Clips that you would not target before. That all through different marketing channels and user experiences. \n\nI agree that it's challenging, no doubt about that.

Stores already had to replace their hardware anyway, Apple just made it so they didn't cheap out and buy stuff that didn't support NFC (which they very much would have since contactless usage in the US was near zero before then).", "That\u2019s not a perfect example either.

It stimulates a card swipe, right?", "MST is certainly nice, and I enjoyed having it on my Gear S3, but I still prefer proper NFC support since it is a little more fluid. The number of times that I\u2019ve waived my wrist around the card swipe at Kroger (who still doesn\u2019t support NFC...) and having to try again more than once to make it catch it made it pretty cumbersome on occasion. \n\nAlso with NFC points, more merchants put out the little tile to tap than they did when it was just card swipes or Chip card readers, so a lot of times I didn\u2019t have a card swipe to tap at all.", "I guess you got downvoted because faking a card is a huge security issue, because you still need a specific application for this, and because it cannot work outside of the US (Europe for example).", "Instant Apps never really took off, did it?

I think the more interesting angle will be to see if small businesses build app clips without having an actual app themselves. Apple said Yelp would be facilitating this idea. Would be a novel way for people to check the menu, see other locations, phone numbers, etc... like a digital brochure.", "Contactless really took off when the US made the switch to EMV because verifone\u2019s most popular terminals at the time had built in NFC, just waiting to be enabled.

Remember, we tried contactless before and it flopped badly (to the point where banks and merchants were pretty much okay not trying again). Hell, there are places that *still* don't let customers anywhere near the terminal despite a pandemic going on.\n\nUnfortunately, the downside is that NFC usage is still pretty low because a lot of people likely tried early on and got frustrated enough not to bother again. Which feeds into comments from others on why the US should have gotten Apple Pay much later than everyone else.", "Absolutely. iOS 14 has a lot inspired by Android, Android 11 has a lot inspired by iOS and at this point, both OS are quite good. Comes down to preference now more than ever.", "They could have made US specific versions without NFC but they had been making the NFC versions in such volume that no merchant was going to  buy the \u201cspecial\u201d one for a higher price. Companies spent millions upgrading their terminals, they bought the ones they knew would have the most support of the global payments industry. International retailers want one system to manage.", "There was something like 10 million+ merchants in the US at the time of the EMV migration, with a fair chunk of retailers having thousands of locations each. It's a big enough market where a country-specific model may have been worthwhile for the big terminal manufacturers. In fact, there are at least a few hardware devices that were originally designed for the US market (namely Square and similar that don't offer hardware PIN pads) and at least one or two of those that still don't sell outside the country.\n\nBTW, the Verifone MX915 and 925 are predominately used in the US. They're sold outside the US, of course, but there haven't been many takers in other countries.

So you can put a price tag (that you pay) for every new person that downloads your app, this cost can be direct ads, marketing campaigns or just development costs.\n\n\n> A lot of rewards card apps mainly don\u2019t make money off advertisements on the app, unless it\u2019s their own product.\n\nThey don\u2019t make money that way. The money is made in other fashions, for example: keeping a consumer consuming regularly, Increasing the user base to increase brand success and market share, tying the consumer to a service, using the large consumer numbers to leverage funds (especially for pre-IPO companies), etc.\n\nUnless consumers are making you bleed with service costs, just having a large user base is a sign of success.\n\n\n> [...] but if that isn\u2019t the case, what would be the reason to not support it?\n\nLogically, there isn\u2019t, as a company\u2019s main target is to sell services, not apps. But certain larger companies have a different long term vision/plan, and can decide against this for many reasons, some are:\n- The want the user to install the app and use it regularly rather than a one time (Uber, Netflix, etc)\n- Some monetize their apps via big data or ads rather than IAP, so an App Clip is against their business model\n- Some want user info rather than the temporarily Login with Apple id\n- Some want to circumvent the Apple 30% fee, so Apple Pay doesn\u2019t interest them (Netflix, etc)\n\nBut, unless it\u2019s an archaic company that can\u2019t adapt to modern times, supporting App Clips should be a non-brainer.", "> Instant Apps were supported all the way back to Jelly Bean (Android 4.2) so no, that's not the problem.\n\nThat\u2019s not true, here is the documentation from Android portal:\n\nhttps://developer.android.com/topic/google-play-instant/overview\n\n> Google Play Instant enables native apps and games to launch on devices running **Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher** without being installed.\n\nAnd this is just starting to be compatible with the Instant API, which needs to be enabled by makers (Some devices are not compatible even if they run the correct OS).\n\nThen, you have linked libraries to offer services. Certain services like *FOREGROUND_SERVICES* or *PHONE_NUMBERS* are only available from Oreo and up.\n\nThat\u2019s what reduces your available market. Along hardware requirements like if your app uses NFC, etc.\n\nEdit: Also adding that the discussion here is why this **wasn\u2019t** more successful at release until now. If we look at market share today, yes Marshmallow and up represent more than 50% of the market share, but it wasn\u2019t the case 2 years ago.", "27:35\n\nIt\u2019s worth quickly glancing over the parts that interest you (iOS, iPadOS, etc), as it\u2019s already super compressed and shows many that will deeply change the upcoming systems.", "Google Play Instant is basically a rebranding of Instant apps.
