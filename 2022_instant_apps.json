You'll most often see a prompt to use an instant app when you're searching for content or shopping through Google search. Instead of reading that content in the website's standard native view, Google will offer to take you directly into the app and show it there, almost as slick as if you'd fully downloaded it.\"", "Thx I just didnt want to have to read the article and was looking for a summary.

From there using views or compose in that activity is straight forward.  \n\nOne other thing I have heard of companies that have a proper website which implement an instant app, is you start to see dropoff from your website because people are getting loaded into your instant app which can drop your tank in search results.
