[{"title": "Android TV gets Google Play Instant Apps, PIN code purchases, and more", "comments": ["I've recently become frustrated with the built-in Chromecast on Android TV. Only the Netflix account signed in on the TV itself can cast to it. If I sign out, then another person has to sign into their account on the TV before they can cast to the TV. It completely removes all the convenience of Chromecast since if someone has to manually sign into the TV anyway they may as well just use the Netflix app on the TV.", "The biggest oversight that still needs to be fixed is better support for multiple users. It's ridiculous that after all this time you still have to fully sign out of YouTube in order for someone else to use their account. YouTube Leanback on other platforms like Roku has had no issues supporting it, but Google seems to have some aversion to fixing it on their own platform.", "Now if android tv on my x950g could stop randomly crash/restarting that\u2019d be nice", "When can we expect Sony to adopt/update to Android 11? 2023 or so? :(", "I wasn't expecting the instant apps on the TV.

I think it had LG's WebOS, so it's not an Android TV specific issue.", "Holly shit yes. We face the same annoyance. I have both roku and androidtv and the experience is almost identical if it weren't for this. Signing out completely is bonkers.", "Every now and then, I get a little sad that I went with an LG C8 OLED, rather than the comparable Sony OLED that year because I sort of want Android TV. Then I see posts like these and I'm glad that WebOS is actually rock solid. It's been nothing short of excellent for me, even if I am missing out on some apps and native Chromecast capability.\n\nApologies mate, because otherwise your TV is excellent. Sincerely hope it gets sorted for you soon.", "This article isn't about Android 11, just the improvements being made to the installed apps.", "My 2 year old Bravia is stuck on Marshmallow. Fuck Sony.", "First thing I tried was disabling the Netflix TV app. TV wouldn't show up in the cast menu for Netflix at all after that.", "I recently bought a Sony 950H and man Android TV is really good. I haven't had any issues yet, but the whole integration with your Google account and the OS has been really enjoyable. \n\nAndroid TV was a big reason why I went with Sony because I just wasn't familiar with LGs OS and Samsung OS is just frustrating to me sometimes. I would really recommend Android TV so far from my personal experience.", "Shield is great \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Hoping for a black friday discount! Do you recommend the pro?", "With the new Shield, it's a little weird... I have the standard  version of the 2nd gen, when basically the only difference was more storage and a larger size on the Pro model. Since USB storage is easy to use, the standard was the one to go with.\n\nNow, USB ports and extra storage are only on the Pro, so I'd personally pick that over the Tube. If you know you're not going to use the extra hardware specs or USB ports, the Tube might be fine. But in that case, might as well save even more money and wait for the upcoming Google device. Those USB ports really make the Shield a powerful device, so I think it's worth springing for.\n\nJust don't bother with the Shield Controller, it sucks. Get an Xbox controller, Dualshock, or 8bitdo controller and you'll be much better off.", "Pro gets you:\n\n1. USB ports\n2. 64bit OS (both have 64bit processor but 64bit apps will not run on the tube)\n3. a little extra storage\n4. will run plex server if you so desire\n\nI had the tube and returned it for the pro specifically because some apps I wanted to sideload apps that only work on 64bit systems.  I also use the USB ports to connect a USB hub, wireless dongles for game controllers and a mouse and keyboard, and a logitech webcam for (Zoom and Google Duo video calls, both sideloaded).  If you don't otherwise have a home NAS plex server, that is a nice bonus, but I have one so I don't use the shield for that.\n\nIf none of what I listed above appeals to you, then the tube is probably fine.  The USB ports do create a lot of possibilities though and I'm sure there are some great uses that I haven't considered."]}, {"title": "Do Instant Apps through the web still work ?", "comments": ["I also tried finding examples and nothing is as advertised.\nI still have a screen grab of the supposed experience, searching vimeo and launching +installing right from the search results, with automatic smart login.\n\nReally sad it's not a thing anymore.\n\nRemindMe!
