Otherwise, [read up on how the Android 6 permissions model works](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.html), and if you have any more questions, feel free to ask.", "[LMGTFY](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=instant+apps+how+to+enable)", "I just tried from a N6P with this feature enabled.

Come on, that's a link from my earlier link under \"You should also read...\", it's like you're not even trying to inform yourself of how permissions work on Android 6.0+.\n\nAlso since it's clear you're not a dev (or at least one who's never attempted to use the 6.0+ permissions system), and since you're not reading the links I'm sending you, I guess you'll only learn from my comments themselves. \n\nPre-Android 6.0, permissions were granted automatically at install time, no matter what. The app wants your location? Granted. Contacts? Granted. There was basically no way around it, if an app wanted your lifestory and pictures of it, they had access to it once you installed the app.\n\nAndroid 6.0 changed all that. If devs built their app against 6.0, all of a sudden dangerous permissions (I'll get to what's \"dangerous\" in a minute) were no longer auto-granted at install time, they had to be approved as you use the app and the app had to explicitly ask the user for this approval. No longer could an app just have instant access to your contacts/location/phone records/etc. unless it asked you for them. This is how the 6.0 permissions model works.  \n\nThere are two types of permissions: normal and dangerous. Dangerous permissions are the following (and can be changed at any time in future versions of Android):  \n\n* Viewing/editing your personal calendar\n* Access to your camera\n* Viewing/editing your contact list and getting a list of your linked email accounts\n* Access to your location\n* Access to your microphone\n* Just about anything regarding voice calls (call logs, making phone calls, processing outgoing calls, voicemail, etc.)\n* Access to body sensors (i.e. heart rate sensor)\n* Anything to do with SMS (sending/receiving texts, reading texts, etc.)\n* Reading/writing to external storage  \n\nIf an app wanted any of the above, it had to ask you (using an unalterable system prompt, to avoid deception or fake \"popups\") and you can either grant or deny the permission. Anything _not_ listed above are what are considered \"normal\" permissions, things like access to the internet, Bluetooth, NFC, setting an alarm, usage of the fingerprint sensor, vibration, etc. These permissions are still auto-granted at install time and cannot be revoked later by you the user.\n\nIt seems that your thoughts on this permissions model are based on I guess news stories and \"Android marketing\" rather than actually knowing how it works on a technical level, and I hope this comment gives you a better understanding of how the 6.0+ permissions model works.  ", "[deleted]", "It seems like /u/ocelost is critiquing the Android permissions system and staying that the creators of the system, Google, are the same people you are trying to protect yourself from with the system, which creates compromises, leading to Google potentially missing or abusing the system, or tailoring it around their agenda instead of the user's (which is claimed to be is main purpose). Furthermore, the permission system can easily be bypassed by even a mildly skilled developer.\n\nWhile it seems like /u/QuestionsEverything is coming from a purely technical stance, staying exactly what the permissions system does. The term \"dangerous\" is being used completely technical, not subjective. He's staying that Google deems permissions that require user interaction to be granted are named \"dangerous\". He is explaining exactly how the permission system works technically, not giving his opinion on it.\n\nBoth of you are arguing on different things.

For instance, locking and unlocking my front door every time I go out is a form of friction. \n\nAnd yes, this can also create extra friction for the end user as well, which is why the concept of Instant Apps was created, it was created as a way to try to remove some of the friction end users face with trying to install Android apps (mostly because users still prefer the capability of native Android apps in some cases instead of web pages). And please note that I've just said \"in some cases\". \n\nIn other cases, a web page may be perfectly satisfactory for end users, and I don't disagree that there will be some examples of developers wasting their time building instant apps when a form on a web page could equally do the job (and which most importantly, will work on all platforms, not just Android).\n\n> It you have to advocate something with a company's selfish interest, I think it's definitely a bad thing.

For people that don't want to watch the video:\n\n1. Apps are refactored into \"components\".\n2. Instant Apps (the thing being sent out) is a framework that handles the deep-links.  It's also a sandbox that basically runs Android apps with a limited set of permissions (basically nothing background-y or access to storage, etc.)\n3. When you click on a link, it goes to some web server.\n4. That web server (say at Buzzfeed) then points at some intent like \"Launch the buzzfeed video app\".  \n5. Android says, \"I don't have that app.\"  \n6. Instant Apps says, \"hold on, there's an instant app version of that!\" and fires up, pulls up the instant app version, downloads only the bits needed, and runs them.\n7.
